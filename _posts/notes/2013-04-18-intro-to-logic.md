#### Introduction
 * Logic -- study of logical sentences.
 * Sentences can be: negations, existential
 * Used everywhere -- logic programming

#### Elements of Logic
 * Syntax
 * Semantics
 * Corollaries: A set of true sentences lead to another.
    - Some conclusions can be drawn based on the given premises; these must be true in all possible cases.
      + It is impossible to check all possible cases to derive these theorems.
      + Aristotle: Rules of inference; content does not matter, structure does; if a premise is true (sound), the conclusion must be true
 * Syntactic Manipulation

#### Need for formalization
 * Ambiguity in natural language
 * Same syntax can have different semantics
