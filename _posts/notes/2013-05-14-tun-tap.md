#### Installing kvm
  
  - Check if the hardware supports kvm

        cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep vmx  # the result should not be empty

  - Install kvm

        sudo apt-get install qemu-kvm libvirt-bin bridge-utils

  - Change /dev/kvm's group to kvm (requires a restart, or at least a
    re-insertion of the kvm kernel mod)

        sudo chown root:kvm /dev/kvm  # allows a non-root user to access kvm

  - Add the user-name of the required user to the kvm, and libvirtd groups

        sudo adduser <uid> kvm
        sudo adduser <uid> libvirtd

#### Creating tap/tun interfaces

  - Creating the interface:

        # Ensure that the owner is set to the required user
        sudo tunct -u <uid> -t tap0  # tunctl apparently only creates tap devices

  - Alternate command:

        ip tuntap add dev tun0 mode <tun|tap> user <uid> group <gid>

  - Bring up the link:

        ip link set tap0 up

#### Creating bridges

  - Creating a bridge:

        sudo brctl addbr br0

  - Bridging interfaces:

        # bridge eth0 <-> tap0 (which was created earlier)
        sudo brctl addif br0 tap0
        sudo brctl addif br0 eth0  # bridges cannot be created for wlans
        sudo ip addr flush dev eth0 # flush the dhcp lease for eth0
        sudo dhclient br0 # acquire new dhcp lease for br0

    This can be added to the start-up scripts, or else the same steps,
    for creating and bring up the bridge, will have to be repeated each
    time the host is rebooted.
