summary: General tips for debugging/profiling/benchmarking
---

In general, there's no fixed rule of thumb that one could use for all
situations, especially with debugging. I think one just gets good at
recognizing common patterns over time. That said, reading postmortems
and debugging stories is quite useful.

Kapil and I were discussing this once when he mentioned that perhaps
the most general rule of thumb is to continuously challenge each and
every assumption, and I agree. I'd also say that gather as much evidence
(or data) as possible and think of the implications. In other words,
hypothesize about a possible path that your program might have taken,
given the evidence, and compare that with the actual implementation.

Here are some recent interesting benchmarking/profiling/debugging stories
I have read.

 - [24-core CPU and I canâ€™t move my mouse](https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2017/07/09/24-core-cpu-and-i-cant-move-my-mouse/)
 - [Fewer mallocs in curl](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2017/04/22/fewer-mallocs-in-curl/)

 - [Treadmill: Attributing the Source of Tail Latency ...](http://yunqi.cat/pdf/zhang2016treadmill.pdf)

Most the stuff that Julia writes on her blog is good, especially for
when one is starting out. Her approach and exposition very clear;
here are some good articles.

Anything from Dan Luu or Brendan Gregg is usually quite good.

Here's one great piece of advice on benchmarking from Gernot Heiser
(of the seL4 fame):
