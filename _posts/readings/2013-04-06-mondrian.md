#### Summary and Notes

Existing approach:

 - Each process has a _separate_ linear demand-paged virtual address
   space
 - The separate linear address spaces implicitly defines the single
   protection domain
 - Granularity of sharing is one page; sharing requires context-switch

#### Comments

Using MMP with [softvm]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url /readings/2013-04-06-smat %}):

A software-managed protection and address translation mechanism could
implement MMP.  Protection domains are independent of virtual or
physical address spaces. A virtually indexed cache hierarchy used
in softvm could implement cache protection table entries. A cache
miss could invoke a software-driven handler to translate the address
and bring it to the cache.

Trace-driven simulation:

The trace driven simulation used by the authors to evaluate their
proposal measures: the required space and referencing overheads;
the PLB; and the sidecar-register behavior. This _model/simulator_
can just be a simple parser of the trace file with a state machine
to produce quick evaluations of the overheads. An implementation
of these features of MMP on a CPU simulator should include: adding
support for all the registers and PLB; adding the permission table
storage for every segment; walking/translating for every memory
reference by a process; and protecting domain context.
