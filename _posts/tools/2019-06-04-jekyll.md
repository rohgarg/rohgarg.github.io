#### General website setup

The most basic structure required is as follows:

```bash
$ tree $PROJECT_ROOT
website
├── Gemfile
├── _config.yml
├── _posts
│   └── 2019-01-01-post.md
└── index.md
```

Here's a basic `_config.yml`:

```bash
$ cat _config.yml
title: "Website"
email: "user@email.com"

markdown: kramdown
theme: minima
```

Technically, the `Gemfile` is only required to compile and run locally. Github
does *not* require the `Gemfile` to be part of the git repository. Here's a
basic `Gemfile`:

```bash
$ cat Gemfile
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "minima"

gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
```

#### Post file format

Jekyll can automatically detect and generate html for new files added in the
`_posts` subdirectory. The post file name and contents need to be in a specific
format for this to work.

1. File name must be of the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-some-name.[md|markdown]`.

2. The post file must have a [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/)
   at the top.

#### Overriding the default theme layouts

Create a directory called `_layouts` in the `$PROJECT_ROOT` and add your
own templates (`*.html` files). Any templates here will override the theme
defaults. New templates can also be added to the same directory.
Here's an example:

```bash
$ tree $PROJECT_ROOT
website
├── Gemfile
├── _config.yml
├── _layouts
│   └── post.html
│   └── projpage.html
├── _posts
│   └── 2019-01-01-post.md
└── index.md
```

A page can inherit from any of the globally or locally available layouts.

#### Setting up tags

It seems like most of the articles online are either outdated or incorrect.

The clean and idiomatic way of accessing all the tags is as follows:

{% raw %}
```html
{% for tag in site.tags %}
{% endfor %}
```
{% endraw %}

Here, each tag is a two-tuple: `tag[0]` refers to the tag name; and `tag[1]`
refers to a list of posts with the given tag.

So, to iterate over all tags and all posts for each tag, one can do something
like:

{% raw %}
```html
{% for tag in site.tags %}
  <ul>
    <li>
      {{ tag[0] }}
      <ul>
        {% for post in tag[1] %}
          <li> {{ post.title }} </li>
        {% endfor %}
      </ul>
    </li>
  <ul>
{% endfor %}
```
{% endraw %}

There's no way for Jekyll to generate the tag-specific pages (a page per tag)
automatically. One would need to go _outside_ the framework and write a
wrapper script (e.g., using Python) to generate the tag-specific pages.

A workaround, I figured, is to put a list of all the tags (and their
corresponding posts) in a single page and create hyperlinks to the tag
anchor from the post page. See the example code [here](https://github.com/rohgarg/rohgarg.github.io/blob/master/_layouts/post.html#L20) and [here](https://github.com/rohgarg/rohgarg.github.io/blob/master/_layouts/tagpage.html#L11).
Here's a cleaner example:

For the single page with all the tags:

{% raw %}
```html
{% for tag in site.tags %}
  <ul>
    <li id="{{ tag[0] }}">
      {{ tag[0] }}
      <ul>
        {% for post in tag[1] %}
          <li> {{ post.title }} </li>
        {% endfor %}
      </ul>
    </li>
  <ul>
{% endfor %}
```
{% endraw %}

For the post page:

{% raw %}
```html
{% for tag in page.tags %}
  <a href="/tags.html#{{ tag }}">{{ tag }}</a>
{% endfor %}
```
{% endraw %}

#### Writing Liquid code in Posts with Jekyll

See [here](http://ozzieliu.com/2016/04/26/writing-liquid-template-in-markdown-with-jekyll/).
(This post also uses the workarounds mentioned on the above linked page.)

#### Jekyll with VSCode

I ended up developing a small VSCode extension, [jekyll-post](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rohgarg.jekyll-post), to ease some of the pain of creating new posts
using VSCode.

There aren't that many extensions for VSCode that can automatically create a
new Jekyll website and help manage the website (build, deploy, etc). There's
definitely room for a new extension here.
