My research interests are in systems and networking, high-performance
computing, fault tolerance, and virtualization.

I'm one of the maintainers of the [DMTCP](http://www.dmtcp.sf.net) project.

In my earlier life (if there is such a thing), I worked for two
start-ups, programming for embedded multi-media communication systems
for some years. If one could rewind time (much like my current
project) even further, one would notice that I managed to complete
my under-graduate degree from Delhi College of Engineering (now
DTU, erstwhile under the University of Delhi) in India.
