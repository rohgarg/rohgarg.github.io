In general, my research work has been in the domain of transparent
checkpointing. My recent work demonstrated:

* novel techniques for transparent checkpoint-restart
  of hardware-accelerated (GPU, RDMA networks) applications; and

* techniques for scalable checkpointing protocols and their use in
  efficient scheduling of processes for large-scale computing
  platforms --- supercomputers and large data centers.

In the past, I have also worked on the problem of classification
of proteins with unknown functions. Our work demonstrated a general
and efficient computational method for protein classification.
